I always found interesting how we attack human qualities tor obots and Ai, or even get attached to them. For instance, we might find the actions of a Roomba funny, or get really sad when our Tamagotchi dies, or even fall in love with Ai. It's as if we get as much emotional fulfillment from inanimate things as we do from actual people. It makes me wonder: what if, in the future, we wouldn't need to rely much on living and sentient beings to meet our emotional needs? What if we could rely on robots and AI to live a happy life? It is through this project, which was also my CE, that I wanted to explore the relationship between humans and robots. Growing up, I was never allowed to have a dog because of my parents. Thus, I sought to build my own. My project is a three-wheeled robot dog that is remote-controlled. By pressing certain buttons on the remote control, the robot will do tricks like a dog. It also has an ultrasonic sensor for eyes, so it can detect obstacles like it is sentient. The robot dog is far from being perfect, but I have come to care much for it. Therefore, I would be devastated if my fur-hating parents were to get rid of it. Fortunately, they would'nt because my dog has no fur.
